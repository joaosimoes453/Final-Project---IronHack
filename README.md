## Price Elasticity of Products - My Data Analytics Bootcamp Final Project

### Project Overview

For my final project, I embarked on an exciting journey to analyze the price elasticity of products within a group of four restaurants over the last seven years. This project aimed to understand how changes in product prices affect demand and to develop insights that can help optimize pricing strategies using the `Prophet` module.

Throughout the project, I executed the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: I collected historical sales data for the past seven years from the invoice software (zsbms) used by the four restaurants in the group. The dataset includes valuable information about product prices, quantities sold, and transaction dates.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: To ensure high data quality, I diligently cleaned the collected data. I handled missing values, eliminated duplicates, and ensured data consistency. The cleaned data is now stored in the `clean_data` directory.

3. **Price Elasticity Calculation with `Prophet`**: To gain insights into the price-demand relationship, I calculated the price elasticity of selected products using the `Prophet` module. `Prophet` proved to be an excellent time series forecasting tool, allowing me to model the demand for specific products while incorporating seasonal effects, trend changes, and holidays in the calculations. The results of the price elasticity calculations are now stored in the `price_prediction_script.pickle` file.

4. **Flask Web Application**: To offer an interactive and user-friendly interface, I developed a Flask web application (`FlaskP.py`). The application empowers users to explore price changes for selected products and view the price elasticity forecasts generated by the `Prophet` model. The HTML templates that define the app's interface are stored in the `templates` directory.

Additionally, I took the analysis a step further by calculating the perfect price, guided by the elasticity insights, without relying on the `Prophet` module. This approach provided an additional perspective on pricing strategies and served as a useful comparison for future price predictions.

Furthermore, I ran the `Prophet` module to forecast future prices based on the historical data. This allowed me to anticipate potential pricing scenarios and make data-driven decisions about pricing strategies in the restaurants.

### Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `clean_data/`: This directory contains the cleaned data files (CSV format) obtained from the invoice software for the last seven years. The cleaned data includes information about product prices, quantities sold, and transaction dates.

- `scripts/`: This directory holds additional scripts or utility files used for data cleaning, preprocessing, price elasticity calculations, perfect price determination, and `Prophet` module integration.

- `templates/`: This directory contains the HTML templates used for the Flask web application.

- `FlaskP.py`: The main Python script for the Flask web application.

- `PRICE ELASTICITY AT A RESTAURANT GROUP.pdf`: A PDF with the presentation of the project.

- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, which provides essential information about the project, setup instructions, and an overview of the project.

- `price_prediction_script.pickle`: A serialized pickle file containing the results of the price elasticity calculations and future price predictions.

### Conclusion

This Price Elasticity of Products project has been a fulfilling endeavor, providing valuable insights into the price-demand dynamics of products within a group of restaurants. By thoroughly cleaning the data, calculating the price elasticity, determining perfect prices, and leveraging the `Prophet` module for future price predictions, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of pricing strategies and their potential impact on overall revenue.

I hope you find this project insightful, and I encourage you to explore the Flask web application to interactively visualize the price changes of selected products over time, view the price elasticity forecasts, and anticipate future pricing scenarios.
